# HomeChoresv2

This application is intended for the whole family. The main focus is that in the family environment all the components of the family unit of the house help to do the daily tasks. This application is designed to make the daily management of these tasks easier while encouraging children to complete tasks to achieve different goals.

Thus, the application allows us to create different tasks and assign them to different members of the family. Each task will have a score, which will be added to the user once he/she marks it as completed.

There are two types of tasks: 
#### Repetitive tasks:#### These are tasks that are repeated one or more times a week. These tasks are marked as repetitive when the task is created. The system takes care of creating new tasks as the old ones are completed.
####Non-repetitive tasks:#### These are tasks that only need to be completed once.

As with the tasks, there is a platform for creating premises. The prizes will be assigned a minimum score and the users will be able to claim it once they reach that score.
	
The application has two different types of users:
#### Administrators:#### These are those who can create and assign tasks. They can also create rewards and a family when they enter the application for the first time.
#### Users:#### These users can neither create tasks nor create rewards. They cannot create a family either. All other features are enabled.
